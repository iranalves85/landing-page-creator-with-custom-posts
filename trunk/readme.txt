== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin work? =
The plugin uses custom posts to compose the sections of a landing page.

You can customize the sections by choosing background color, background images or video, and edit content in the same way as an ordinary post.

Go to the plugin's configuration page in the side menu by locating in "Settings -> Landing Page Creator With Custom Posts". You will find a table listing all current WordPress pages, just select your options and save.
